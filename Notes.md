# Notes

## 29/06/25
- Didn't achieve anthing major today, erased the previous config on the 2901 router and switch, then enabled ssh and telnet connectivity from the router to the switch to simplify changing between each device.
- Current plans are to connect my laptop to the network and attempt to gain access to it through the router using ssh or telnet.
