# Home-Network-Project

Got my hands on some Cisco hardware recently and want to set up and poke holes in a network (at home) to further understand how everything works. This repo is the documentation for my testing of the network.

## List of hardware:
1. Cisco 5506-x firewall
2. Cisco 2901 router
4. Cisco as2511-rj terminal router
5. Cisco switch (version currently unknown)
